portal.azure.com

--> got to the create resource
--> like we want to create web app so search for web app and then create the web app
--> create new resource group
--> select java version
--> select java SE
--> region West Europe


once your web app is created then you can see FTP there
The FTP host details would be useful when you would want to
deploy a new version of the application using FTP. Let's say, you would want to directly
copy the deployable unit into the server where our application is deployed.
Thats where your published profile and the FTP details will be really usefull


** if you want to deploy a new version of application then  you can go to the
   deployment center

** if you want to deploy multiple environments for the same application then you can
   go to the Deployment Slots

** if you want to see logs like whats happening behind the application then can search
   log in resources ( web app ) that we created. there is Log Stream and App Service Logs
   by default they are switch off you can turm them on by going into the app service logs 
   settings.

** Configuration: you might want to configure something around the application.
   So, you might want to configure an environment variable or something of that kind
   so, in that kind of situation, you can go to configuration. Configuration is present
   in the settings part of the menu.
